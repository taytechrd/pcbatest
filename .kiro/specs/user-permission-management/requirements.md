# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PCBA Test System currently has a basic role-based access control system with static roles (admin, technician, operator). This feature will implement a comprehensive dynamic user permission management system that allows administrators to create custom roles, assign granular permissions, and manage user access rights through a web interface. The system will provide fine-grained control over what users can view and perform within the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create and manage custom roles with specific permissions, so that I can control access to different parts of the system based on organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the role management interface THEN the system SHALL display all existing roles with their descriptions and status
2. WHEN an administrator creates a new role THEN the system SHALL allow setting a unique role name, description, and active status
3. WHEN an administrator assigns permissions to a role THEN the system SHALL provide a categorized list of all available permissions
4. WHEN a role is saved THEN the system SHALL validate that the role name is unique and store the role-permission associations
5. WHEN an administrator deactivates a role THEN the system SHALL prevent new assignments but preserve existing user assignments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to assign specific permissions to individual users, so that I can grant or deny access to particular features regardless of their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views a user's permissions THEN the system SHALL display both role-based and individual permissions clearly
2. WHEN an administrator grants an individual permission THEN the system SHALL add it to the user's permission set
3. WHEN an administrator denies an individual permission THEN the system SHALL override any role-based permission for that user
4. WHEN permission changes are saved THEN the system SHALL log who made the change and when
5. WHEN a user's permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the changes to their active session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view and manage all system permissions in organized categories, so that I can understand and control access to different system modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the permissions interface THEN the system SHALL display permissions grouped by module (user_management, test_management, etc.)
2. WHEN viewing permissions THEN the system SHALL show the permission name, description, and which roles/users have it
3. WHEN an administrator creates a new permission THEN the system SHALL require a unique name, description, and module assignment
4. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL validate that critical system permissions are not accidentally removed
5. WHEN a permission is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from all roles and users after confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with assigned permissions, I want the system to enforce my access rights consistently, so that I can only access features I'm authorized to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected page THEN the system SHALL check their effective permissions before allowing access
2. WHEN a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an appropriate page with an error message
3. WHEN menu items require specific permissions THEN the system SHALL hide or disable inaccessible options
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate permissions before processing requests
5. WHEN a user's permissions change THEN the system SHALL update their interface immediately without requiring re-login

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit user permissions and access attempts, so that I can maintain security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission changes are made THEN the system SHALL log the change, who made it, and when
2. WHEN users attempt unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with user details and requested resource
3. WHEN an administrator views audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by user, permission, date range, and action type
4. WHEN audit data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear timestamps, user information, and action details
5. WHEN audit logs reach a certain age THEN the system SHALL provide options for archiving or cleanup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to bulk assign permissions to multiple users, so that I can efficiently manage permissions for groups of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects multiple users THEN the system SHALL provide options to assign or remove permissions in bulk
2. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with details of what will change
3. WHEN bulk changes are applied THEN the system SHALL process each user individually and report any failures
4. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed changes
5. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log each individual permission change for audit purposes
