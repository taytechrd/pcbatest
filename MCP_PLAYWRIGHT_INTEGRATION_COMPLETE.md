## 📊 MCP Test Features

### **Comprehensive Logging**
Every action is logged with detailed metadata:
```python
📝 MCP Log: playwright_navigate - success
   Details: {
     "target_url": "http://localhost:9002/login",
     "actual_url": "http://localhost:9002/login", 
     "page_title": "PCBA Test Sistemi - Giriş"
   }
```

### **Smart Form Handling**
```python
# MCP-enhanced form filling with validation
success = mcp_test_runner.mcp_fill("input[name='username']", "admin")
# Automatically logs field validation and success
```

### **Advanced Screenshots**
```python
# MCP-enhanced screenshots with metadata
screenshot_path = mcp_test_runner.mcp_screenshot("test_result.png", full_page=True)
# Logs file size, path, and capture details
```
